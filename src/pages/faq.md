<br />

### What are you working on nowadays?

Nothing big at the moment. Mostly studying and maintaining [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app).

<br />

### What is your favourite programming language?

[OCaml](https://ocaml.org) is definitely my favourite language. It combines an expressive syntax, powerful type inference and an efficient garbage collector, making it a great choice for general purpose programming. It also helps me approach programming problems in a more intuitive and streamlined way.

<br />

### What is your favourite web framework?

[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) has got to be my favourite framework, I love all the magic and crazy features it has. I'm also loving [Astro](https://astro.build) at the moment. [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com) is promising.

<br />

### Did you build create-t3-app?

I started it, the community built it. If you don't know, [create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) is the quickest way to start a web app with the full stack typesafety.

<br />

### What code editor do you use?

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and the occasional [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

<br />

### What terminal emulator do you use?

I use [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org). It's great.

<br />

### What theme do you use?

I use [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) for Neovim, [Mellow](https://github.com/kvrohit/mellow.nvim) for Alacritty and tmux, and [Serendipity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wicked-labs.wvsc-serendipity) for VSCode.

<br />

### What font do you use for coding?

I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) for coding. The monospace font being used in this website is [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).
