I'm the type of person who is constantly working on open source projects. But whenever I create a new repository, I haven't yet decided what license I should put the code under. So, I always had to add it at the end when I have pushed all the code. But it was just too much work: go to GitHub, click `Create File`, type `LICENSE`, choose the license and then push it and finally pull the changes locally. So I decided to make a CLI License Generator, in Rust.

<br />

This was a nice project to build since I hadn't written Rust code in a while, so it was a good refresher.

## Introducing gen-license

It's as simple as that, it even automatically gets your username from your global git config file!

Here's the source code: [toshiki/license-generator](https://github.com/toshiki/license-generator).

<br />

## Installation

```bash
cargo install gen-license
```

If you don't have cargo installed, you can download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/toshiki/license-generator/releases) section of the GitHub repository.

<br />

## Usage

```bash
gen-license
```

That's pretty much it! Thank you for reading this far. If you want me to explain some of the code behind this, feel free to ask in the comment section.
