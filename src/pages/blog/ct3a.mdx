[create-t3-app](https://github.com/toshiki/create-t3-app) recently reached 90 stars on GitHub and is my most popular open source project with a lot of people contributing. Now you may be wondering, what the hell is it? Let's take a look at the t3 stack and how you can use create-t3-app.

<br />

## T3 stack

<br />

The T3 stack was made by [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoBrowne1017) who is a really cool dev and makes awesome content on YouTube. The stack consists of:

<br />

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

<br />

I love this stack, if you want to know more about them checkout [init.tips](https://init.tips) and [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DhravyaShah/status/1540589276810711040) from @dhravya.

<br />

The only downside of this stack is the boilerplate, I had to open the docs, install all the packages, create a bunch of files just to set it up.

<br />

Theo had also mentioned on stream how it would be very convenient to set up a project just by running `npx create-t3-app`. So I did just that!

<br />

## create-t3-app

<br />

`create-t3-app` makes it really convenient to scaffold a starter project using the T3 stack.

<br />

### Usage

```bash
npx create-t3-app@latest
# or
yarn create t3-app
# or
pnpm create t3-app@latest
```

It will let you select the packages you want and install them and create all the files those packages need.

<br />

I started working on the CLI in May and back then I had no experience with Node CLIs, but it was definitely a great learning experience for me.

<br />

Now the project has matured a lot and it's amazing to see Theo's community opening issues and contributing everyday, it's really great.

<br />

## Maintaining Open Source

<br />

I have a lot of respect for OSS maintainers now because honestly, it is a really hard job. Looking at issues, reviewing and discussing PRs, it's definitely a bit tiring.

<br />

I recently had burnout from this and took a 2 day break and just built a bunch of static sites. Theo's community is awesome though, we agree on most things and I rarely write code for the CLI now, people just open issues and make PRs, I just have to review and merge them.

<br />

Overall this project has been a really great experience, I learnt so many things, from node CLIs to maintaining open source. Please do try the CLI out and open issues if you find bugs.
